		<name>Lake Terreton (paleo Mud Lake) Seds Polygon</name>
		<description><![CDATA[Estimated from data i Anderson et al 1996 (OFR96-248) and Anderson et al 1997 (OFR97-4010). Sediment layers generally fairly thin, <50 feet in most sections, but may be up to 100 feet. 

The outline of Lake Terreton seds is very approximate. It could be smaller and narrower (confined to moat north of volcanic axial high).]]></description>
